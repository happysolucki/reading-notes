# Relationship between HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

### HTML Text Semantics

Here are some HTML text semantics that I wasn't privy to beforehand:

#### &lt;cite&gt;

You would typically use this when referencing a piece of work like a book, play, film, etc. to indicate where the citation is from. Browsers tend to render this content in italics.

#### &lt;address&gt;

This designates an element that contains the contact details for the author of the page. It can contain a physical address, but it doesn't have to. Browsers tend to render this content in italics.

#### &lt;ins&gt; & &lt;del&gt;

The `<ins>` element can be used to show content that can be inserted into a document. The `<del>` element does the exact opposite; it can show text that has been deleted from it. Typically, the `<ins>` content is rendered with an underline while the `<del>` content is rendered with a strikethrough.
