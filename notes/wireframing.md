# Wireframing

**Wireframes** are simple visuals that web and UX designers create in order to plan the information hierarchy of a website or app. Wireframing helps designers organize the structure and content of a page before starting the visual design process. This step helps ensure that content flows in an intuitive way from page to page.

The wireframing process can involve multiple stages. Typically, designers start with a rough sketch on paper, which is then translated into a digital wireframe using wireframing or design software. Finally, the digital wireframe is fleshed out into a high-fidelity prototype. When the prototype is approved, the project is ready to move into the development stage. We'll explore the wireframing process in more detail later on.

It might seem like doing this is unnecessary, but doing this ahead of time can noticeably increase the speed of development. Having a skeleton of what you want to achieve gives you a visual guide to follow. This will also limit the amount of revisions you might have to make to your design in the future.

To start out, get some paper & a pen to sketch out a sitemap. A **sitemap** is a simple chart that lays out the page hierarchy of a website. Creating sitemaps first helps you get clear on how the website content will be organized so you can create wireframes that flow logically.

Once you have your sitemap laid out, use it to make your wireframe. While doing this, consider writing in the **main headlines** from the website content. This'll be a great aid in visualizing how you want the content on your website to flow. Once you have this all on paper, you can go recreate this using digital software like Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Affinity Designer, etc.

This is the stage where you focus on the **structure** & **content** of your page. Don't worry about brand logos, colors, typography, etc. just yet. A good practice is to include the actual text for the website, as opposed to filler text. This will help you discern how large different sections should be and which elements need to stand out.

Usually in a profession environment, this is the point where you seek out feedback from a client or your supervisor/manager. Once they can see how their content will be laid out on the page, they'll be able to give you constructive criticism on certain areas. Do be sure to clarify that this is a wireframe and not a mockup or prototype.
