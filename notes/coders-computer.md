# Coder's Computer üñ•Ô∏è

Here are some tips for setting up a coding-focused computer:

### Text Editor

There are a plethora of very powerful text editors out there. Choose one that best suites your needs. Here are some of the most prominent:

- Visual Studio Code
- Sublime Text
- Brackets (Deprecated)
- Atom
- Vim/Neovim

Personally, I use Neovim. I greatly appreciate the movements I can make using the Vim bindings. Plus, Neovim/Vim is out-of-the-box is more lightweight the other text editors listed here. Granted, part of the reason why it lightweight is due to it not being as feature-rich on first install as say VS Code. There are a lot of Neovim/Vim extensions that can replicate the same features as VS Code, while also being able to bo beyond anything that's available in most other text editors.

### Command Line

The first line in your terminal is more than likely you prompt.
Typically a command is always the first thing you type.

After entering a command, like `ls`, some lines may pop up. That is the output of the command that was just ran. Most commands produce output and it will be listed straight under the issuing of the command. Other commands just perform their task and don't display any information unless there was an error.

#### Common terminal commands that  I know

These are a couple of unix terminal commands I know:

- ls (lists all files & folders in current/chosen directory)
- ls -a (lists all files/folders, even those that are hidden)
- cd (change directory)
- git clone (clones git repository)
- git add (stage a file/directory in git repo)
- git commit (commit staged git changes)
- git push (push commits to git repo)
